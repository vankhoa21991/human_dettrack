# Human Detection and Tracking Project

![Human Detection and Tracking](data/image.png)

## Overview

This personal project focuses on human detection and tracking using computer vision techniques. The primary objective is to identify and track human subjects in video streams or sequences of images, with potential applications in surveillance, robotics, and more. The project utilizes popular deep learning models and libraries to achieve precise human detection and tracking.

## Features

- **Human Detection:** Identifies and localizes humans within images or video frames.
- **Human Tracking:** Tracks detected humans across multiple frames to maintain their identity.
- **Real-time Processing:** Designed for real-time operation with live video streams.
- **Modular Design:** Easily extendable with different detection and tracking algorithms.
- **Visualization:** Provides visual feedback with bounding boxes around detected humans and tracking paths.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```shell
 git clone https://github.com/yourusername/human-detection-tracking.git
 cd human-detection-tracking
```

4. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

```shell
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

3. **Install dependencies:**

```shell
python -m venv venv
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Configuration: Modify the configuration file config.yaml to set your preferred detection and tracking algorithms, camera sources, and other parameters.
2. Run the Application:

```shell
python run_tracker_simple.py
```

3. View Output: The application will display the video stream with bounding boxes around detected humans and tracking paths (if enabled).

## Configuration

The config.yaml file allows you to customize various aspects of the application, including:

- Detection model selection (e.g., YOLO, SSD, Faster R-CNN).
- Tracking algorithm (e.g., Kalman filter, SORT, DeepSORT).
- Video source (camera feed or video file).
- Thresholds for detection confidence and tracking.
